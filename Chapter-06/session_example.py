# Chapter-06/session_example.py

"""
An example of creating a stateful agent with conversation memory.

This script demonstrates how to use a `Session` object to give an agent
memory across multiple turns of a conversation. By passing the same session
object into each run, the agent can access the history of the entire
conversation, allowing it to remember previous interactions and answer
context-aware questions.

The `SQLiteSession` implementation provides persistent storage, meaning the
conversation history is saved to a file and will be available even if the
script is stopped and restarted with the same session ID.
