# Chapter-06/session_editing_example.py

"""
An example of programmatically editing an agent's session memory.

This script demonstrates an advanced technique where a developer can fetch an
agent's conversation history, modify it, and then update the session. This
is a powerful tool for correcting mistakes made by the user or the agent,
injecting system-level context, or summarizing long conversations to manage
token limits while preserving key information.
