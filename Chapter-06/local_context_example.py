# Chapter-06/local_context_example.py

"""
An example of using local context to create stateful agents.

This script demonstrates a powerful pattern for making agents aware of
application-specific data (like the current logged-in user) without
including that data in the main prompt to the LLM. The local context is
passed securely to tools, allowing them to behave differently based on
this information.
