Additionally, Macron stated via a post on the social media platform X that Ukraine's future must be decided by Ukrainians themselves. This declaration came amid news that U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. According to Trump, the upcoming talks may involve land concessions—a proposal that Ukrainian President Zelenskiy rejected earlier on the same day. These developments underscore ongoing international efforts to resolve the conflict while emphasizing Ukraine's insistence on maintaining sovereignty in all diplomatic decisions.

## Military Spending Increase
In response to evolving global security challenges, President Macron announced an additional €6.5 billion in military spending over the next two years. This decision aims to address unprecedented modern threats, including Russia's aggression, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and cyberattacks. Macron emphasized the importance of military power for national and European security and reaffirmed France's support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. By 2027, he aims for annual defense spending to reach €64 billion, doubling the 2017 level. He also proposed initiating a strategic dialogue on the French nuclear arsenal’s role in European defense, highlighting new cooperation with Britain on nuclear security.

## Legal Action Against Defamation
President Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against right-wing influencer Candace Owens on July 23, 2025. The suit centers on Owens’ claim that Brigitte Macron was born male, under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux—Brigitte's older brother’s actual name. The Macrons allege that Owens has engaged in a “campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying” to promote her podcast and gain followers, resulting in significant personal distress and public damage. This legal action marks a rare defamation suit by a world leader, emphasizing the serious nature of the claims.
