# Chapter-02/hello_agent.py
"""
A simple script to demonstrate the basic execution of an AI agent.

This file shows how to define an agent with a specific goal, provide it
with a user's question, and use a Runner to get the AI's response.
It's a foundational example of an agent's lifecycle.

    # contains useful information about the execution, including logs and
    # intermediate steps. For this example, we are interested in the
    # `final_output`, which holds the agent's direct response to the user.
