# Chapter-04/parallel_translation.py

"""
An example of a parallel multi-agent workflow using asyncio.

This script demonstrates how to run multiple, independent agents concurrently.
Two specialist translator agents are created and run at the same time to
translate a piece of text into two different languages. This pattern is
highly efficient for tasks that don't depend on each other, as it can
significantly reduce the total execution time compared to running them
one after another.

        # --- The Core of the Parallel Pattern ---

        # 1. Create "tasks" for each agent run.
        # Calling an `async` function like `Runner.run` doesn't execute it
        # immediately. Instead, it creates a "coroutine" objectâ€”a work
        # order that can be run later.

        french_task = Runner.run(french_translator, user_message)

        # 2. Run the tasks concurrently with `asyncio.gather`.
        # `asyncio.gather` is the magic here. It takes all our prepared
        # tasks and tells the event loop to run them all at the same time.
        # It then waits until the last task is complete before returning.
        results = await asyncio.gather(spanish_task, french_task)

        # 3. Unpack the results.
        # `asyncio.gather` guarantees that the list of results is in the
        # same order as the tasks we passed in, making it safe to unpack.
