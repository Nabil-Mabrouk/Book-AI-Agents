# Chapter-04/handoff_agent.py

"""
An example of a handoff (or triage) multi-agent workflow.

This script demonstrates a powerful pattern where a "manager" agent, called
a TriageAgent, analyzes an incoming request and delegates it to the most
appropriate "specialist" agent from a team. This allows for the creation
of robust systems that can handle a wide variety of tasks by routing them
to experts.
