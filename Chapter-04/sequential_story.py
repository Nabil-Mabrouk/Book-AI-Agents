# Chapter-04/sequential_story.py
"""
An example of a sequential multi-agent workflow.

This script demonstrates how to chain two agents together to perform a
multi-step task. The first agent creates a plot outline, and its
structured output becomes the direct input for the second agent, which
writes a full story. This pattern is powerful for breaking down complex
problems into a series of specialized tasks.
