# Chapter-11/mcp_filesystem_example.py
"""
Demonstrates an agent connecting to a **language-agnostic tool server** using
MCP.

This script showcases the power of MCP to connect Python agents to tools
written in any language. It uses `npx` to run a pre-built, Node.js-based
filesystem server, and the agent automatically discovers and uses the tools
(like `readFile`, `listFiles`) that the server exposes.

This script shows how to:
1.  Run a non-Python tool server (Node.js) as a managed subprocess.
2.  Use the `async with` pattern for robust server lifecycle management.
3.  Pass the server connection directly into an agent's `tools` list to
    trigger automatic tool discovery.

Prerequisites:
- Requires Node.js and npx to be installed and available in your system's PATH.
