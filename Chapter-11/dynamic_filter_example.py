# Chapter-11/dynamic_filter_example.py
"""
Demonstrates how to use a **dynamic tool filter** to create a sophisticated,
context-aware access control policy for agents.

Unlike a static filter, a dynamic filter is a function that runs every time
an agent tries to discover tools. It can inspect the context of the request‚Äîsuch
as the name of the agent making the call‚Äîand decide on a tool-by-tool basis
whether to grant or deny access.

Key features demonstrated:
1.  A filter function (`dynamic_filter_for_experts`) that implements role-based access control.
2.  The filter allows an "Expert" agent to access a specific tool (`get_weather_forecast`).
3.  The filter blocks a "Novice" agent from accessing the same tool.
4.  The filter is passed directly to the `MCPServerSse` connection.

Prerequisites:
- Requires a tool server (like the one in `my_tool_server.py`) to be running
  and offering both an "add" and a "get_weather_forecast" tool.
