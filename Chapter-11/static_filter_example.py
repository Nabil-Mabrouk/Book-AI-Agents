# static_filter_example.py
"""
Demonstrates how an agent can use a **static tool filter** to limit its own
access to a server's available tools.

This is a powerful **security and scoping feature**. It allows a general-purpose
agent to connect to a powerful tool server but restricts its capabilities to
only what is necessary for its specific task, reducing the risk of unintended
behavior or misuse.

Key features demonstrated:
1.  Uses `create_static_tool_filter` to define an **allowlist** of tools (`add`).
2.  Applies this filter to an `MCPServerSse` connection via the `tool_filter` parameter.
3.  Shows the agent successfully using an allowed tool.
4.  Shows the agent being unable to use a tool that was blocked by the filter.

Prerequisites:
- Requires a tool server (like the one in `my_tool_server.py`) to be running
  and offering both an "add" and a "get_weather_forecast" tool.
