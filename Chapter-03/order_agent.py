# Chapter-03/order_agent.py
"""
An advanced agent example demonstrating the use of tools.

This script defines a tool `get_order_status` that an AI agent can use
to answer user questions about e-commerce orders. It showcases how to:
1.  Define a structured output for a tool using Pydantic.
2.  Create a tool using a decorator (`@function_tool`).
3.  Equip an agent with the tool to solve a specific task.

# By defining a Pydantic model, we tell the agent exactly what kind of
